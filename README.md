### 🧠 About BINGIO
Unlike Netflix, which relies on viewing history and algorithms, and ChatGPT, which offers static lists, **BINGIO** curates personalized movie and show recommendations that match your **mood**, **context**, and **vibe** — through natural, human-like conversation.  

It doesn’t just suggest *what* to watch — it understands *why* you need it right now.
